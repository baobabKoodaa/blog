A long-running question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4752501/move-the-mouse-pointer-to-a-specific-position" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>
asks: can a website move your mouse cursor? The answer which is marked as ''accepted'' unequivocally states ''it isn't possible''. The most up-voted answer (with 195 upvotes) is even more dramatic:

> You cannot move the mousepointer with javascript. Just think about the implications for a second.

Well, I like a good challenge. And guess what? It's done. I've been tinkering with this idea for a while now and decided to release it on this special day (International Cybersecurity Day). You can try it for yourself <a href="/mouse/" target="_blank">here</a>.
