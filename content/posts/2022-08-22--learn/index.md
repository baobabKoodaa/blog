<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning Coursera Course</a> by Andrew Ng

**Skill:** Machine Learning -- learn how to apply existing machine learning techniques, understand why they work, and how to troubleshoot issues.

**Type of material:** Videos and coding exercises

**Why is it good:** Great interplay between lectures and exercises. Clarity of explanations. Introductory scope. Enough math to understand why these methods work, but not too much.

<a href="https://cses.fi/book/index.php" target="_blank">Competitive Programmer's Handbook</a> by Antti Laaksonen

**Skill:** Exact algorithms -- learn how to invent algorithms for ''code competition'' -type problems (problems where exactly-correct answer is required and the main challenge is time or memory complexity).

**Type of material:** Book

**Why is it good:** Simplified explanations of many algorithmic techniques and algorithmic problem solving approaches. Unlike most algorithm books, this one is focused on ideas and code, not on the underlying math. This is the ''bible'' of Finnish competitive programmers.

<a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/" target="_blank">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a> by Sean Luke

**Skill:** Optimization algorithms -- learn techniques to find ''good enough'' solutions for problems where an exactly-correct solution is not required. Typically used when an exact algorithm would be computationally infeasible and machine learning methods can not be applied. For example, route optimization often falls into this category.

**Type of material:** Book

**Why is it good:** A practical approach. Scope. Clarity of explanations. I recommend you to read this book while implementing and testing selected approaches on a real problem as you go along.
